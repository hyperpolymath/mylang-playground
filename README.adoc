== Overview

My-Lang is a progressive language family where each level builds on the previous, creating a learning path from simple to AI-native programming.

== The Progression

== Language Levels

=== Me (Personal)

Beginner-friendly, focused on personal projects.

[source,me]
----
-- Simple syntax, helpful errors
say "Hello, world!"

-- Gradual typing
name = "Alice"
age: Int = 25
----

=== Solo (Systems)

Low-level control with safety.

[source,solo]
----
-- Linear types, manual memory
type Buffer = linear { ptr: *mut u8, len: usize }
fn free(buf: Buffer) -> ()
----

=== Duet (AI-Assisted)

Human-AI collaboration.

[source,duet]
----
-- AI helps implement from intent
intent "optimize for speed":
    @ai_implement
----

=== Ensemble (AI-Native)

Multi-agent applications.

[source,ensemble]
----
-- Orchestrate AI agents
ensemble Team:
    agents: [Researcher, Editor]
    workflow: research |> edit |> approve
----

== This Playground

Experiments with the My-Lang family:

* `me/` - Me language examples
* `progression/` - Code evolution across levels
* `interop/` - Cross-level interoperability
* `tooling/` - Shared development tools

== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
# Install the family
guix install mylang-suite

# Start with Me
me run hello.me

# Progress to Solo when ready
solo build systems.solo
----

== Philosophy

* **Progressive Disclosure**: Learn what you need when you need it
* **Smooth Transitions**: Code can migrate between levels
* **AI as Partner**: AI assistance grows with skill level
