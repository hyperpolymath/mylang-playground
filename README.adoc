toc::[]

== Overview

My-Lang is a progressive language family designed to grow with you. Start with fundamentals, build real applications, and optionally add AI capabilities when needed.

== The Family

== Which Dialect Should I Use?

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Dialect |When to Use |Repository

|**Me**
|Learning to program (ages 8-12), no experience
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/me-dialect-playground[me-dialect-playground] ⭐

|**Solo**
|Building real applications (ages 8+, after Me)
|link:hives/solo/[hives/solo]

|**Duet**
|Need AI to help write code (industry/final year)
|link:hives/duet/[hives/duet]

|**Ensemble**
|Building multi-agent AI apps (industry/advanced)
|link:hives/ensemble/[hives/ensemble]
|===

TIP: Most programmers use **Solo** for their entire career. Duet and Ensemble are specialized tools for specific AI use cases.

== Quick Start

=== New to Programming?

[source,bash]
----
# Start with Me (standalone repository)
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/me-dialect-playground.git
cd me-dialect-playground
deno task demo
----

=== Ready to Build?

[source,bash]
----
# Clone this playground with all hives
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyperpolymath/mylang-playground.git
cd mylang-playground

# Explore the dialects
cd hives/solo      # Systems programming
cd hives/duet      # AI-assisted
cd hives/ensemble  # Multi-agent
----

== Dialect Details

=== Me (Fundamental Concepts)

**For ages 8-12, no experience required.**

Learn programming concepts with friendly, visual syntax. Safe sandboxed execution with immediate feedback.

[source,html]
----
<say>Hello, world!</say>

<remember name="pet">cat</remember>
<say>My pet is a {pet}!</say>

<choose>
  <when pet-is="cat"><say>Meow!</say></when>
  <when pet-is="dog"><say>Woof!</say></when>
</choose>
----

=== Solo (Systems Foundation)

**For ages 8+ (after learning Me concepts), through undergrad and beyond.**

The core language. Low-level control with safety. Linear types, memory management, WebAssembly.

[source,solo]
----
type Buffer = linear { ptr: *mut u8, len: usize }

fn allocate(size: usize) -> Buffer {
    // Safe memory allocation with linear types
}

fn free(buf: Buffer) -> () {
    // Resource automatically freed, cannot double-free
}
----

=== Duet (AI-Assisted)

**For final year students / industry professionals who need AI integration.**

Human-AI pair programming. The AI helps implement from intent.

[source,duet]
----
intent "optimize for speed":
    @ai_implement

intent "add error handling":
    @ai_suggest
----

=== Ensemble (AI-Native)

**For industry professionals building multi-agent AI applications.**

Orchestrate teams of AI agents with complex workflows.

[source,ensemble]
----
ensemble Team:
    agents: [Researcher, Editor, Reviewer]
    workflow: research |> edit |> review |> approve
    consensus: majority
----

== Philosophy

* **Progressive Disclosure**: Learn what you need when you need it
* **Solo is Complete**: Most programmers stay with Solo forever—and that's fine
* **AI When Needed**: Duet and Ensemble are tools, not requirements
* **Smooth Transitions**: Code patterns are similar across dialects
