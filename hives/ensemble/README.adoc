== Overview

Ensemble is the culmination of the My-Lang family, designed for building AI-native applications where multiple AI agents collaborate with humans.

=== Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI agents
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless human oversight
* **Distributed AI**: Scale across nodes
* **Consensus Protocols**: AI agents reach agreement
* **Auditable Decisions**: Track all AI reasoning

== Language Design

=== Agent Definition

[source,ensemble]
----
agent Researcher:
    capabilities: [web_search, summarize, cite]
    constraints: [factual_accuracy, source_verification]

    fn research(topic: String) -> Report:
        let sources = web_search(topic)
        let summary = summarize(sources)
        Report { summary, citations: cite(sources) }
----

=== Multi-Agent Collaboration

[source,ensemble]
----
ensemble DocumentReview:
    agents: [Researcher, Editor, FactChecker]

    workflow:
        1. Researcher.draft(topic)
        2. Editor.review(draft) |> FactChecker.verify
        3. human_approval(reviewed_draft)
        4. publish(approved)
----

=== Consensus

[source,ensemble]
----
fn collective_decision(agents: [Agent], question: Query) -> Decision:
    let votes = agents.map(|a| a.vote(question))
    let consensus = reach_consensus(votes, threshold: 0.7)

    match consensus:
        | Agreed(decision): decision
        | Disagreement(positions):
            escalate_to_human(positions)
----

== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
guix install ensemble
----

== Examples

* `multi-agent/` - Multi-agent collaboration
* `consensus/` - Consensus protocols
* `human-loop/` - Human oversight patterns
