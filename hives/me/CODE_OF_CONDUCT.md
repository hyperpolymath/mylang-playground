# Community Code of Creative Practice (CCCP)

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in the My Language
project a harassment-free, emotionally safe, and empowering experience for everyone,
regardless of:

- Age, body size, disability (visible or invisible)
- Ethnicity, nationality, race, skin color
- Gender identity and expression, sex characteristics
- Level of experience, education, socioeconomic status
- Personal appearance, political beliefs, religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- Neurodiversity, mental health status
- Technical background or skill level

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive,
and emotionally healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Emotional Safety

**We prioritize:**

- **Anxiety reduction**: Clear expectations, no hidden rules

- **Doxxing**: Publishing private information without permission
- **Intimidation**: Threats, aggressive behavior

- **Dismissiveness**: "RTFM", "just Google it", gatekeeping
- **Toxicity**: Sarcasm used to hurt, condescension

- **Surveillance**: Tracking contributors without consent
- **Gaslighting**: Manipulating someone's perception of reality

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

### Perimeter 1: Trusted Core (Private)
- Maintainers with commit access
- High trust, high responsibility
- Code review requirements: 2+ approvals
- Security-sensitive changes

### Perimeter 2: Active Contributors (Invite-Only)
- Proven track record (3+ merged PRs)
- Elevated permissions (issue triage, discussions)
- Mentorship opportunities
- Code review requirements: 1+ approval

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (Public)
- **This is where you start!**
- Open to everyone
- Fork freely, experiment boldly
- No permission needed to contribute
- Welcoming environment for beginners

**Progression:** Everyone starts in Perimeter 3. Consistent, quality contributions
and alignment with our values lead to invitation to Perimeter 2. Exceptional
commitment and technical expertise may lead to Perimeter 1.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying and enforcing standards
- Taking fair, appropriate action for violations
- Removing/editing/rejecting contributions that violate this Code
- Communicating reasons for moderation decisions

## Scope

This Code applies to:
- All project spaces (GitHub, chat, email)
- Public spaces when representing the project
- Private communication if it affects project safety

## Enforcement

### Reporting

**If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:**

1. **Immediate safety**: If you feel unsafe, prioritize your well-being
2. **Report**: Email maintainers (see MAINTAINERS.md) or use GitHub's reporting
3. **Details**: What happened, when, where, who was involved (if comfortable sharing)
4. **Support**: We will support you, maintain confidentiality

**We promise:**
- Confidentiality (unless legally required to disclose)
- No retaliation against reporters
- Timely response (within 48 hours)
- Fair, transparent process

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

#### 1. Correction
**Impact**: Minor, unintentional violation (e.g., inappropriate language)
**Consequence**: Private warning, explanation of violation, request for apology
**Example**: "That phrasing might be hurtful because..."

#### 2. Warning
**Impact**: Moderate violation or pattern of minor issues
**Consequence**: Written warning, temporary interaction restrictions (7-30 days)
**Example**: Repeated dismissive comments despite correction

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact**: Serious violation or sustained inappropriate behavior
**Consequence**: Temporary ban from all project spaces (30-90 days)
**Example**: Harassment, threats, doxxing attempt

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact**: Egregious, illegal, or sustained pattern of violations
**Consequence**: Permanent ban from all project spaces
**Example**: Severe harassment, illegal activity, repeated serious violations

## Appeals

If you believe enforcement action was unjust:
1. Email maintainers within 14 days
2. Explain why you believe the decision was wrong
3. Maintainers will review (different people from original decision)
4. Decision communicated within 7 days

## Emotional Temperature Metrics

We track community health through:
- **Anxiety levels**: Do contributors feel safe experimenting?
- **Reversibility**: Are mistakes treated as learning opportunities?
- **Response time**: How quickly do we welcome new contributors?
- **Diversity**: Are voices from all backgrounds heard?
- **Burnout**: Do we respect boundaries and work-life balance?
