= Me Dialect → Moved to Standalone Repository

[IMPORTANT]
====
The **Me dialect** has been moved to its own standalone repository for a better educational experience.

**→ https://github.com/hyperpolymath/me-dialect-playground[Go to Me Dialect Playground]**
====

== Why the Move?

The Me dialect is designed for children ages 8-12 learning to program for the first time. It deserves its own dedicated space with:

* Child-focused documentation and tutorials
* Progressive learning levels (1-5)
* Visual, safe, sandboxed environment
* Standalone installation without the complexity of the full My-Lang family

== What's Here?

This directory contains legacy code from when Me was part of this repository. It will be removed in a future update.
